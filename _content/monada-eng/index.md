In June 2022, I joined the young cloud startup [Monada](https://www.linkedin.com/company/monadahq/about/). Monada's goal is to simplify development in the cloud.

## What problems does Monada want to solve?

The problems Monada wants to solve are on developer and organization level.

### Developer level

The developer level primarily addresses problems for us cloud developers.

**Long Iterations**. The duration of development iterations in the cloud is still too high! Even though it has been reduced in the last years by tools like Serverless and CDK (CDK TAGS) we Monadians believe it is still too high!

**Steep Learning Curve**. Mastering cloud tools such as CloudFormation, Terraform or CDK takes many months. This is way too long and we want to reduce this time to a few days!

**Difficult to Debug**. Debugging cloud applications is too cumbersome! Often different system need to be involved for this. For example, if I want to debug a Lambda on AWS, I first have to log into the AWS Console and then search for the correct logs in Cloudwatch. We will simplify this!

**Complicated Unit Tests**. Implementing unit tests in the cloud is usually not easy. For example, elaborate mocking libraries have to be used to mock certain aspects in the cloud. We believe this is easier!

**High development costs**. The complexity in the cloud results in high costs as many cloud experts have to be paid to handle exactly this high complexity. We at Monada believe that our solutions will make the cloud more accessible and thus require fewer experts.

### Organizations Level

**Internal Platforms**. Especially in larger organizations, it can become necessary to create internal platforms to monitor and manage cloud resources. The creation of such platforms naturally generates additional costs. We Monadians want to simplify the development with the cloud so that such additional platforms are not needed.

**Lock-In**. There are already many approaches to avoid a lock-in with a specific cloud provider. However, in our opinion, these approaches are far too complicated and can be replaced with new more radical approaches.

**Slow evolution**. The high complexity in the cloud requires longer development times. Thus, of course, costs increase. At Monada, we believe that development time can be massively reduced.

## How is Monada going to do that?

Now you're right to ask how we're going to do that, after all there's already tons of material out there for learning about the cloud. Well, all of us at Monada think that the cloud in its current form is way too complicated. The cloud needs to be rethought or made simpler. And that's exactly what we're working on at Monada.

Unfortunately, I can't be more specific about our solutions yet, as they are still in development. But I can reveal this much. We are using RFCs to design the approaches and the ones I have seen and worked on so far give me goose bumps. I'm very grateful to be a part of Monada and all the cool stuff we have going on.

## Summary

In this post, I gave you an insight about my exciting journey at Monada. I explained what problem we want to solve and how we plan to do it. Of course, this endeavor is not an easy one and we need your help!
