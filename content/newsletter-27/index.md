<https://thenewstack.io/what-made-golang-so-popular-the-languages-creators-look-back/>

An interesting history telling about GoLang and how it became so popular. TBH, I didn't worked much with GoLang so far so it is hard for me to see the gold. If you have a project with GoLang and need some help, let me know :)!

Thanks a lot to the author []()

Uh that is super attractive. Building a complete open-source company. I super like that idea. Being an open-source would include sharing the salary

## How to Use Feature Flags

<https://dev.to/bentorvo/how-to-use-feature-flags-39md>

Why and how you can use feature flags. A very appealing part for feature flags, I find the possiblity to roll the feature out to production but disable it quickly if it is causing problems. As well in combination with A/B Testing feature flags can be used to rollout the changes only to a part of the customers.
