Hi Alfrescans.

On May 11, 2020, Alfresco will host a virtual hackathon. You can find the current project ideas here at [hub.alfresco.com](https://hub.alfresco.com/t5/news-announcements/alfresco-virtual-hack-a-thon-may-2020-project-ideas/ba-p/298030). With this post I want to invite you to participate.

# Why Participate?
There can be several reasons why you should participate. If you like the Alfresco products, it's great to help develop the products further or even create completely new ones. For example, I would like an SSL Companion Container for the [Alfresco Docker Installer](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-docker-installer). Without further ado, I simply registered the project to help organize and implement it.

It is also a great opportunity to make contacts with motivated developers from all over the world. During my time at Alfresco, I got to know smart and helpful developers, from whom I learned a lot. I am always looking for opportunities to learn and the hackathon is the perfect opportunity for that.

My company would also like to organize a hackathon in the future and the Alfresco Hackathon could be a perfect opportunity to learn how to organize such hackathons.

The best reason: why not? It could be an interesting new experience for you and if you don't like it you can go at any time and just don't take part next time.

# Summary
The Alfresco Hackathon on May 11, 2020 is just around the corner. In the starting blocks my friends :)! After the event I will report in the form of a post here how I liked the hackathon. By 11 then and stays healthy :D!
