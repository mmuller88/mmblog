## Improve DX by publishing an API SDK - a CDK Serverless example

https://www.rehanvdm.com/blog/improve-dx-publishing-an-api-sdk-cdk-serverless

Uii an API SDK is a nice idea. For me that looks similar to OpenAPI / Swagger SDKs. It seems to be a smart combination of OpenAPI SDK and TypeScript. Plus with a sophisticated CI/CD flow like posting to slack you can make developer earlier aware of SDK changes. Interesting idea please read the full article!
