Would you like to grow your Discord community? [Chatsindex.com](https://Chatsindex.com) indexes messages from selected Discord channels and makes them findable for search engines like Google. Through SEO (Search Engine Optimization) it is ensured that the entries appear as high as possible in the search results. This way new users can be attracted to your Discord server.

Below you can see an example how a Discord channel and the search results can look like:

![seo.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmuller88/mmblog/master/content/chatsindex/seo.gif)

The Google page is only mocked ([Chatsindex.com/search](https://Chatsindex.com/search)) because it is still a prototype.

## How does it work?

A Discord bot writes the messages into a database. The database is then queried by a NextJS server and rendered into a search engine optimized (SEO) page. The page is then crawled by Google and the entries are then discoverable.

The prototype is built using the [T3 Stack](https://martinmueller.dev/t3-stack). The T3 stack is a NextJS stack with TailwindCSS, tRPC and Prisma. The database is currently SQLite and is queried with tRPC and Prisma. The page is rendered using NextJS and TailwindCSS.

## Participants

Does this idea sound interesting to you? Then feel free to contact me [https://MartinMueller.dev](https://MartinMueller.dev). I am looking for volunteers with Discord servers to test the idea.

## Outlook

If the idea is well received, I would like to index other private chat systems like WhatsApp groups, Telegram groups, Slack, etc.

Another idea of mine is to implement an overarching search for private chats like Discord, WhatsApp groups, Telegram groups and Slack. With certain keywords or categories, private chats with certain topic content can then be found. For example, if I'm interested in financial education, I can then simply enter finance in the search and I'll be presented with Discord servers, WhatsApp/Telegram groups, etc. with a focus on finance. If you like the idea, feel free to contact me.

## Conclusion

I think the combination of SEO and Discord servers is an exciting idea. For now I want to test the idea and see if there is any demand for it. If you are interested, feel free to contact me.
