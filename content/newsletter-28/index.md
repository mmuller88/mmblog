## Automating AWS account bootstrapping with AWS-CDK

<https://medium.com/@andrewfrazer/automating-aws-account-bootstrapping-with-aws-cdk-117e5ead1c51>

Super interesting article for how to CDK bootstrap new accounts in a more DevOps way. Very cool is the idea that whenever a new account is created with Control Tower that will trigger an AWS CodeBuild job to bootstrap he account.

Thanks a lot to the author [Andrew Frazer](https://medium.com/@andrewfrazer). And thank you for being a very active member in the CDK Community.

Highlights KeePassXC as non cloud hosted password manager. I use it since some years now and I like it too :). I use it for Mac laptops as well.

Thanks a lot to the author [Rob OLeary](https://dev.to/robole)

A nice discussion to give a kind of a small roadmap for DevOps and helps to understand wrong expectations about DevOps.

## The Cost of Production Blindness

https://dev.to/codenameone/the-cost-of-production-blindness-48aj

Super nice input in one of my favorite topics production. I totally agree that we need to peek more into production. What is the problem when you don't do that and some attempts how to do it are explained in this article.

Thanks a lot to the author [Shai Almog](https://dev.to/codenameone)

## AppSync and DynamoDB Lessons Learned
