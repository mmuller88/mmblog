## Motivation

* Mother died with only 66 years old. 
* Had an unhealthy lifestyle
* I hope to convince my father having a more healthy moving livestyle
* he is a believer. Wrote a book
* My father lost his wife my mother recently
* He is very depressive and I try to find a book which might helps him through his depression
* He is in a bad physical shape and I want him to move more but he is very afraid of moving
* He is a strong believer in God
* So my goal is to write a book which combines aspects of believing in God and moving

## Get the book idea

* So with the AI I first mad research in which category this kind of book fits and how many words it should have:

Prompt:

```txt
In which category fits a book about good in combination with the importance of moving and how many words it should have.
```

The main takeaway for me from the answer was:

```txt
Self-Help:

If the book offers practical advice, personal development strategies, and motivational content related to the benefits of movement for physical and mental well-being.
Typical length: 50,000 to 80,000 words.
```

So I'm going to write a self-help book with 50,000 to 80,000 words for my father. 

## Outline the book

Next I wanted to outline the book. So which topics and content it could have.

Prompt:

```txt
What could be the content of the book of "God loves you and therefore you should love yourself and get moving" ?
```

I ran this comment against ChatGPT and Claude from Antrophic. The answer were a bit different and I choosed that on I liked most.
