Hi there,

I recently developed an MCP Server with using our [HalloCasa Zapier Integration](https://zapier.com/apps/hallocasa/integrations). 

* Zapier MCP is nice but I wanted to try AWS Bedrock AgentCore Gateway to develop an MCP Server
* Because it allows you to leverage an OpenAPI Spec as target which we already have
* I was curious to see how it would perform
* Additionally adjusting our openapi spec to serve better as an MCP Server improves the the spec

## Conclusion

...

If you want more details, like how I build the MCP integration or how I deploy the NextJS app via AWS CDK, reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinmueller88/). I'm super eager to share my knowledge with you.
