**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Hi folks.

As in October 2019 I had the amazing opportunity to buy a house in the beautiful town called Ludwigslust in Germany. It is an old but recently renovated lovely house. As I'm much interested in tech I couldn't wait to try some cool Smart Home stuff.

This article is about my experiences with Smart Home gadgets. My highest priorities were to save costs like electricity or gas in the long run and increase the living quality from me and my wife.

There are dozens of Smart Home solution out there and you need to be very careful which one you will go with as often gadgets from different vendors are not playing nicely together.

I decided to buy gadgets which can be controlled with the 'Smart Life' app, as it has a huge offer on all kinds of Smart Home devices.

# Which Wireless Frequency?
It is important to mention that all of my Smart Home gadgets only are working in a 2.4 GHz wireless network. It is unlikely that you find gadgets for the 5 GHz network. 2.4 as the length of the waves are longer compared to 5 GHz it reaches better through walls but having a smaller bandwidth. Actually Smart Home devices don't need a high bandwidth, so thats fine. Make sure to establish both of those network frequencies on your router!

# Smart Light Bulbs Everywhere
I opted in buying the Smart WLAN LED lights from Teckin. If you but the package containing four bulbs you save some money compared to buy just one. What can I see I really love those Smart bulbs. I already saved money with just replacing the existing bulbs which ran on 40 W to use those Smart bulbs which just need 8 W to shine.

As it is just natural to forget turning out the light and it already happened I configured every replaced bulb to turn off at 1 am as usually no one is wake at this time anymore. Anyway there are some places in the house, where the wifi signal is not strong enough. For that case I didn't installed a smart bulb. I only replaced the 40 W agains a simple LED ones.

# Smart Sockets
The next smart device were the Smart Socket with two USB Ports. I love those sockets as they have a bunch of nice functionality. First as we in Germany don't have manual switch integrated in our sockets it is very convenient that those smart sockets have an on off switch. Than you don't need to force pulling out if you want to cancel the power.

The next cool feature of those sockets is that you can configure a time schedule for switching off and on devices. I do use a schedule off switch on my TV station as there are a bunch of devices which I would like to be cut off at night to save money. So I configured the TV smart socket to turn off at 1 am. An other off schedule is on the microwave. As it is an old microwave it spends a lot of energy even just being ind standby. That wasn't acceptable so the microwave turns off at 7 pm and 1 am. If you want to turn it on again, simply press the button on the socket.

Last but not least the washing machine has a smart socket between as well. Three reasons for that. As well the on off switch is practical. It saves energy a bit because I turn off the standby. And really cool I configured the "Smart Life" app to send me a notification when the cloth is done washing. That is possible because you can trigger a notification event when the power level reaches a certain level. I love that!

# Smart Garage Door

Imagine if you could open your door with just saying "Hey Siri, Garage". Well thats the case for me. And still until now I feel like Batman and his cave open kind of automatically when he gets close :D. So very very cool. How I did that? ...

# Time Scheduled Thermostats
Very happy I am with my "Smart" thermostats from Eqiva Radiator. Though I am not sure if they are falling under the category Smart Home devices as they are basically just configurable through the display and I am currently only using them for time scheduled heating. Anyway there were very easy to install and they do work like a charm.

# Futur Ideas
I feel like that I just started my little Smart Home Journey. Soon I would like to try more complex systems like the Tado Smart Radiator system. As well I am thinking about to create my own private Smart Home Server running an a PI. I found some interesting article regarding that in the c't's Sonderheft Smart Home.

# Summary

Smart Home devices are not just tools for playing around with. They actually help you to save some bucks and can increase your living quality. If you think about peeking in the Smart Home devices world start with relatively simple devices like those wifi Smart Bulbs and Smart Sockets which doesn't need any other devices to work and are cheap. Be creative for how you can use them in a smart way. And yeah most important have fun!
