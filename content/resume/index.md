Martin built the sophisticated AWS infrastructure for our online lab environments. Working with him was characterized by very good communication and a very fast implementation of the tasks set. Martin works very professionally and has great experience with AWS environments. He is able to quickly grasp the requirements and promptly develop solution approaches. His concepts are scalable and comply with best practices in cloud environments. Thanks to his support, we got a stable cloud environment for our HackLabs in a very short time, which we still use today.
