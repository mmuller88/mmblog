Hi folks.

What a week. Close by the Azure Meetup started happening again after like 2 years. Was great to see my old Meetup friends again. You might think wait what why Azure you are an AWS guy? Yes, true but learning more about the other cloud providers is super exciting and as well my new company Monada aims for multi-cloud :).

In this weekly newsletter, I write a summary of posts that got my attention during the week. I center around topics AWS, DevOps, Architecture, AWS CDK, Serverless, Data Engineering, Data Analytics and much more.

If you like my content follow me on my usual spots to hang around:

## Is Zero Trust Architecture Possible??

<https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/zero-trust-architecture-possible-shashank-abhishek/>

An article about the zero trust architecture. It is an interesting approach. The author lists and explains the zero-trust principles. In the serverless world, some of those are implemented easily or even already part of the service. But yeah it would be nice if the developer wouldn't need to regard zero trust principles to much and they would be already part of the IaC framework. That is as well what we plan to work on in Monada :).

## How Do You Overcome Imposter Syndrome?

<https://dev.to/janicera2880/how-do-you-overcome-imposter-syndrome-55m8>

Such an important topic as the author speaks about the imposter syndrome. It is super common in the developer's area. The author provides super nice and useful tips for how to overcome imposter syndrome. I would like to add that if you give your best every day as a developer you don't have to blame yourself! Giving your best also includes things like relaxing, detaching, time with your family, playing a game, and time for workouts. Being a developer is about you! Embrace that as I do :)!

Thanks a lot to the author [Janice Alecha](https://dev.to/janicera2880)

## Building Serverless Applications That Scale The Perfect Amount

<https://dev.to/aws-builders/building-serverless-applications-that-scale-the-perfect-amount-410p>

A very in-depth article about designing an architecture that scales small, medium or large. Nice idea to compare the different scales. For me, it is super exciting that with like AWS CDK it allows you with relatively low costs to change your design from small to medium or even too large. There are only a few articles like that out there so read them!

Thanks a lot to the author [Allen Helton](https://dev.to/allenheltondev). And check out his other amazing posts which I regularly cover in my newsletters ^^.

## Why you should learn TypeScript today

<https://dev.to/omerwow/why-you-should-learn-typescript-today-dmo>

Yeah, a super good article about TypeScript and why you should learn it. I personally love TypeScript. What I like most is that it is super spread in different areas like language for IaC for AWS CDK or AWS SDK TypeScript or React TS. Furthermore, you can use the huge ecosystem around JavaScript. As well the discussions are worth a read!

Thanks a lot to the author [Omer Elbaz](https://dev.to/omerwow)

## What's your biggest problem while working with AWS

<https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/vhgmr4/whats_your_biggest_problem_while_working_with_aws/>

Wow interesting discussion about the biggest problems in AWS. I find the struggle with AWS permissions interesting and provided an answer to try AWS CDK as it made juggling with permissions easier than pure with pure CFN before.

## Control Cost And Security Weakness On Your AWS SandBox Accounts

<https://blog.shellkode.com/control-cost-and-security-weakness-on-your-aws-sandbox-accounts-609670b1146d>

Cool, the author presents a bunch of Lambda's to help clean sandbox accounts. And what is cool is the lambda is written in Python.

## Open Source Projects

In this section, I list Open Source projects I find super interesting!

## CDK Bill Bot

<https://github.com/cremich/cdk-bill-bot>

Super interesting AWS CDK collection of L2 and L3 constructs for AWS Cost and Usage reports. Definitely will try it out for the private project I am currently working on. The Creator Christian Bonzelet is a super experienced and active member of the CDK Community and an AWS Community Builder. So worth checking out!. Thanks to my friend Christian :)!
