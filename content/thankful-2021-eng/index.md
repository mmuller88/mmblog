A warm hello,

Once again this year I would like to say thank you. For the year 2021, the family was the focus. Of course, my thank you notes from my previous [post](https://martinmueller.dev/thankful-eng) still apply! In this thanksgiving I would like to say thanks specifically for 2021 and its events.

## God

This year, too, you God have laid your protective hand over us. You have blessed us with health and love. So far we have been spared from Corona and I maintain that our lifestyle has not changed due to Corona this year. Please keep us safe also in 2022.Amen.

## Grandma

Do you know who my second biggest role model is? Well my biggest is Jesus. After that comes my grandma Katharina Lauck. She passed away towards the end of November. At 93 years old and 26 clock grandchildren, she had a full life and is now with her Lord.

She was always a great grandma. However, it wasn't until her funeral that I realized what a great person she was too. I heard many great stories from her past. She was truly a kind-hearted woman. She made the world a better place and that is my goal as well. Thank you grandma for everything. Rest in Peace.

## Wife and daughter

Of course, I especially thank you both again 2021. We are very blessed with a healthy daughter and a great mommy and wife. You two have made 2021 extraordinary! Because of you two, I feel continuously strong and ready to face all everyday problems and professional challenges. Thank you so much you two.

## My mother

Also this year I would like to thank especially my mother. She is always there for us when we need her. I am also very grateful to her that we can always borrow her car when we need it. Also wonderful is the strong bond between her and Rebecca (our daughter). Thank you for being such a great, helpful and loving grandma <3 .

## Sogros (Parents in law)

My in-laws came to stay with us from Brazil in the middle of December. I am very grateful that you are here and supporting us so great. I am looking forward to two more great months with you guys. I love you guys so much :) !

## Solarmon

From the bottom of my heart I want to say thank you to my ex-colleagues from the Solarmon project. It was a very exciting time and I had a lot of fun implementing new features with Blazor and DotNet. The development team consisted of two developers and a product owner.

The developers were a senior and a junior whose position I held. I especially enjoyed working with the senior the most. We had great professional discussions.

Towards the end of 2021, however, I had made the tough decision to focus more on AWS again. Thank you very much for the great time and I wish you all the best for 2022 with the Solarmon project.

## Summary

2021 was a great year. Even though there is a lot more I should say thanks for, I'll make a start in this post. What were you thankful for in 2021?
