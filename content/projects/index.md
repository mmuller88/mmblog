## Alfresco as a Platform
I work on an Alfresco as a Platform solution to simplify the deployments of Alfresco a lot. In fact you don't need to deploy anything anymore and just can use created Alfresco instances.

If you want to know more have a look at my [Alfresco Provisioner Post](https://martinmueller.dev/alf-provisioner-eng). I'm happy to create an test account for you!
