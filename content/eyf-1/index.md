Did you notice the cool blog title picture? I love writing blog posts and choosing nice pictures for them. It is actually one of two randomly selected pictures. But often I want to choose THE BEST picture. So to find the best picture I'm using AB Testing. If you are curious about it, have a look at the <https://ab-picturer.com> tool and provide me feedback or even better become an engaged tester :).
