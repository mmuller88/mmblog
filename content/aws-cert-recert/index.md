Hi friends.

My AWS Solution Architect Professional expired mid 2022. I was thinking about renewing it since then occasionally but I didn't want to invest the massive amount of time to prepare for it. But a client of mine is paying for it so why not.

## Learning for the exam

But what was my strategy to reduce the amount of time to prepare but still passing the exam? A great way is learning via test exams [UDEMY AFFILIATE]. For once they are preparing you for the test exam mode. And for other it is a great way to have a amazing learning when you answer a question wrong.

...

## Registering

* Time get's closer
* you prepared for weeks perhaps months

### Remote or In-Person

* do at the test center or at home?
* I think at home if you have a change to have a quite room for those 4 hours
* You know when your brain works best and your are most productive

### Which Day?

* soon as possible when you decide to make the exam
* do not expand the time of being nervous by booking to far ahead

## Conclusion

* Tell me your opinion.
Preparing for the exam isn't fun but you can make it fun! Enjoy the learnings during preparing for it.
