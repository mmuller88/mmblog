Hi friends.

My AWS Solution Architect Professional expired mid 2022. I was thinking about renewing it since then occasionally but I didn't want to invest the massive amount of time to prepare for it. But a client of mine is paying for it so why not.

But what was my strategy to reduce the amount of time to prepare but still passing the exam? A great way is learning via test exams [UDEMY AFFILIATE]. For one they are preparing you for the test exam mode. And for other it is a great way to have a amazing learning when you answer a question wrong.

## Conclusion

Preparing for the exam isn't fun but you can make it fun! Enjoy the learnings during preparing for it.
