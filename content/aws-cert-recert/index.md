Hi friends.

My AWS Solution Architect Professional expired mid 2022. I was thinking about renewing it since then occasionally but I didn't want to invest the time to prepare for it. But now a client is paying me for taking on the exam so why not.

## Learning for the exam

First of all appreciate Learning! Learning is fun and preparing for the exam is fun!

My preferred way of efficiently learning is doing test exams like you get them on Udemy or other learning platforms. For once they are preparing you for the test exam mode. And for other it is a great way to have an amazing learning when you answer a question wrong.

### Learn in Chunks

The main goal when using those test exams should be to maximize your learning with chunking your learning as this works better for humans. For this I don't think you should answer all the 75 questions in one row. Rather you should only answer like 5, 10 or 15 to see at the review stage what you answered wrong and write your learnings down. The goal is that you have one or two questions wrong which give you a great learning opportunity. If you get all questions right you might want to increase the number of questions you are answering during the next session or continue to the next test exam. With this you can have everyday amazing learnings.

### Loud sticks

Read questions out loud and try to say important keyword like `media company`, `cost-efficient` or `availability` specially loud. I find myself paying more attention to the questions and answers when doing it this way. This is not just useful when preparing for the exam. It is useful during the exam as well.

So you maximized already your learning opportunities through my tips so now let's get to the next phase the registration and the actual exam.

## Registering

First of all do not fear failing! Unfortunately failing is still not to much accepted in our society but failing is awesome as long as you learn from failing and try to do it better next time. Well look at my two cute little children. They were failing all the time like when trying to walk or to speak but they never gave up and now they are walking and speaking like a pro.

So I suggest you that you register for the test if you reach like 70% correct answers of a new test exams test like you get them on Udemy or other learning platforms. Don't wait until you get like 90% right. As sooner you try as better. Because even if you fail you can analyze the results and see where you need to improve and just keep learning.

Sure paying those 300 or what dollar for the exam isn't easy affordable for everyone. Yes you getting a fair point there! If that is difficult for you to effort try to get one of those vouchers to either reduce or completely remove the costs. I know for example that the AWS Community Builder program is giving you an exam voucher every year.

### At home or not

When registering for the exam you can choose the location between from home or in a test facility. Both are great choices. I will choose home because I know that I am most productive at home and I can have a quite room for those 4 hours. As well I know when my brain works best and that is after my morning workout and after taking my hot-cold shower. I'll use this little brain boost for the exam.

### Celebration

Celebrate your exam journey! Celebration is fun and we usually do it to less. Celebrate your everyday learning. Celebrate the registration and celebrate the passing or failing of the exam.

## Conclusion

Preparing and doing the exam is fun but! Enjoy the learnings during preparing for it. Tell me your tips for passing those exams :)!
