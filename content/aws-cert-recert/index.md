Hi friends.

My AWS Solution Architect Professional expired mid 2022. I was thinking about renewing it since then occasionally but I didn't want to invest the massive amount of time to prepare for it. But a client of mine is paying for it so why not.

## Learning for the exam

First of all appreciate Learning! Learning is fun and preparing for the exam is fun!

### Learn in Chunks

But what was my strategy to maximize the fund but still to reduce the amount of time preparing for the exam? A great way is via test exams [UDEMY AFFILIATE]. For once they are preparing you for the test exam mode. And for other it is a great way to have an amazing learning when you answer a question wrong.

The main goal when using those test exams should be to maximize your learning opportunities. For this I don't think you should answer all the 75 questions in one row. Rather you should only answer like 5, 10 or 15 to see at the review stage what you answered wrong and write your learnings down. The goal is that you have one or two questions wrong which give you a great learning opportunity. If you get all questions right you might want to increase the number of questions you are answering during the next session. With this you can have everyday amazing learnings.

### Loud sticks

Read questions out loud and try to say important keyword like `media company`, `cost-efficient` or `availability` specially loud. I find myself paying more attention to the questions and answers when doing it this way. This is not just useful when preparing for the exam. It is useful during the exam as well.

So you maximized already your learning opportunities through my tips so now let's get to the next phase the registration and the actual exam.

## Registering

First of all do not fear failing! Unfortunately failing is still not to much accepted in our society but failing is awesome as long as you learn from failing and try to do it better next time. Well look at my two cute little children. They were failing all the time like when trying to walk or to speak but they never gave up and now they are walking and speaking like a pro.

So I suggest you that you register for the test if you reach like 70% correct answers of a new test exams test [UDEMY AFFILIATE]. Don't wait until you get like 90% right. As sooner you try as better. Because even if you fail you can analyze the results and see where you need to improve and just keep learning.

Sure paying those 300 or what dollar for the exam isn't easy affordable for everyone. Yes you getting a fair point there! If that is difficult for you to effort try to get one of those vouchers to either reduce or completely remove the costs. I know for example that the AWS Community Builder program is giving you an exam voucher every year.

### Remote or In-Person

* do at the test center or at home?
* I think at home if you have a change to have a quite room for those 4 hours
* You know when your brain works best and your are most productive

### Which Day?

* soon as possible when you decide to make the exam
* do not expand the time of being nervous by booking to far ahead

## Conclusion

* Tell me your opinion.
Preparing for the exam isn't fun but you can make it fun! Enjoy the learnings during preparing for it.
