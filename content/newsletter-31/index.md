## Aurora Serverless v2 PostgreSQL vs. provisioned Aurora PostgreSQL

<https://towardsaws.com/aurora-serverless-v2-postgresql-vs-provisioned-aurora-postgresql-f60a93b99b83>

That is an interesting article which compares the costs from Aurora Serverless v2 PostgreSQL vs Aurora PostgreSQL . And as you can read in the article it isn't always more cheap! Actually it seems Aurora Serverless should be avoided when you have high DB traffic. So therefore perhaps use it for development and later consider switching to Aurora on-demand!

Thanks a lot to the author [Ian Binder](https://medium.com/@ianbinder)

## CDK: Certificate Handling with Custom Resources

<https://blog.56k.cloud/cdk-certificate-handling-with-custom-resources/>

In this article the author uses AWS CDK Custom Resources to solve a problem with DNS validating a certificate. As the custom domain isn't managed by Route 53 you can't use the standard route53 constructs to do that. Super smart how the author solved it with using a custom resource.

Thanks a lot to the author [Jochen Zehnder](https://blog.56k.cloud/author/jochen/)

Interesting article for how to use the AWS Marketplace with AMI and CloudFormation type to earn money. As well the story of product marbot from cloudonaut.io is super fascinating.
