Pictures are super important when advertising! With AI the generation of picture became super easy. But how do you validate if the picture is rocking it at your audience? Easy! You can do A/B Picture Testing. A/B Picture Testing uses two different pictures and lets them compete against each other. The picture that performs better wins and will be used to improve the numbers of visitors.

## My A/B Picture Testing Use Case

I like to write technical blog posts on my blog site https://martinmueller.dev . For those post I like to use a main picture which can be used as a thumbnail and main picture for the post.

I build a tool for me which I call A/B Picture Testing. In the next section I explain how it works.

## How does my A/B Picture Testing Tool works?

Use picture Urls to collect information like when the picture was previewed and when the user decided to open the post. That process is called Click-Through. The A/B Picture Testing Tool can then calculate the Click-Through-Rate (CTR) for each picture. The picture with the higher CTR wins and can be used as the main picture for the post.

## Join the A/B Picture Testing Discord

- helping you to try out the tool
- post feature requests

In the next section, I will show you how to integrate and use the A/B Picture Testing Tool.

## Integrate A/B Picture Testing in Your Blog Post

It doesn't matter what exact blog post engine you are using as long as they support showing pictures it should work.

- Use imag tag for your post <img> ...
- Use Meta tags for preview image url ...
- Post in on socials

## Outlook

- dev.to not working because they are doing some chaching for the picture
