Hello AWS fans.

On 3rd December AWS announced the ...

# Alfresco's Kubernetes Deployment
Alfresco K8S deployment ... Github DBP ...

# Using Fargate as Managed Pod Service
Create EKS cluster with eksctl and configure Fargate Namespace ...

# Smart Sockets
The next smart device were the Smart Socket with two USB Ports. My first intend with buying those was to turn off devices which would spend a lot of energy otherwise. Another advantage is that you don't need to use force to unplug the device from the outlet which is really cool in my opinion. I used one for a microwave which doesn't need to have the LED display turned on at night. Another Smart Socket I plugged into the outlet next to my night stand at the laptop and phone doesn't need to be in the charging mode at night, as they are usually already charged.

# Limitations
No data volumes supported so far, but look like soon EFS will be supported ...

## My Amazing Equipment:
**Alcohol tester**: Great for figuring out if you are in ketosis or not. \

**Omron Scale**: Measures not only your body weight. Can estimate your body fat, water and muscle composition as well. \

**Bare-Foot Shoes**: Perfect shoes for workouts like tabata, gym or running. Normal modern shoes are bad for your feet as they are overprotecting to your foot which will result in underdeveloped foot muscles and skeleton. A good developed foot is the basement of your body and prevents all kind of resulting issues like knee or back pain. There are many of expensive bare-foot shoes out but some cheap water shoes are completely sufficient. \

**Bluetooth Earphones**: I tested many different bluetooth earphones. I am sticking now with this one because they are cheap but are from very good quality regarding sound, battery and robustness. I can use them for weeks for my workouts without ever charging them! \

**Gymnastic Rings**: Perfect tool for upper body workout. I love it to train outside in the sun and fresh air. As well they are very light so you can take them with you wherever you go. \

**Stainless Steel Water Bottle**: That drinking water is crucial I don't need to explain. I prefer those steel water bottles because there is not risk of plastic in your water. \
