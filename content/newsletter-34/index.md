## Sign your AWS Lambda packages

https://faun.pub/sign-your-aws-lambda-packages-39d3be4b18b8

It is about AWS Signer to put a signature on your Lambda code package. That is for security to make sure that no one tempered with your Lambda code. That is super cool and I didn't even know that you can do that. Though there are some manual steps needed to sign a package. I am curious if I somehow could automate that more with AWS CDK. If you know the answer let me know ^^.

Thanks a lot to the author [Jean Velez Torres](https://medium.com/@jean.velez2?source=post_page-----39d3be4b18b8--------------------------------)
