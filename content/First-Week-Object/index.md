Hello.

In this article I briefly summarize the first week at [OBJECT](https://www.object.ch). For me myself this belongs to North. On the one hand I practice writing articles and on the other hand serves as a reflection on the previous days. As they say, my dream job as a software engineer is so important. This art of blog post may need to be understood better. I hope you heard.

# Day 1 onboarding

It was originally different that I should come to Zurich for onboarding. In short, onboarding usually means the company of the new employee with the hardware and the various software systems that were made, as well as the various tasks. Certain my wife got the last weak and I wanted to be reluctant to leave her.

The better and very interesting I got when OBJECT offered me to do the onboarding in Hamburg. I love Hamburg because it is a beautiful city on the water. In the cover picture you can see the Church of St. Jacobi in Hamburg, which I noticed immediately on the way to onboarding. I was given three exciting main tasks. I can only write about these in very rough details.

The first task is that I have my own project together with another partner. This project is called itself with a very exciting use outdoors. In this deployment, ACS (Alfresco Content Service) and APS (Alfresco Process Service) should run together. It is super exciting that I am allowed to connect Alfresco's ECM and BPM products with quality.

The second project is about developing a prototype for the elucidation of sensitive data. For that we also like to hear a chic ADF app. In this project, my own knowledge gained with Docker and ADF will be able to be fully exploited.

In the age and well for me most exciting project it is about that OBJECT like a social social media representation. That would go from platforms like Xing, LinkedIN to small YouTube videos. Again, I have a great interest based on my old knowledge of Alfresco law and my own lost but existing social media skills.

This for this day I can say that the day was very fitting, but also very productive and great, war. I am very happy that OBJECT has big plans for me.

# Day 2 project launch
My great Brazilian colleague, also called Amigo by me, took the time to give me the current ACS 5.2. Application deployment. I devoured all the details and asked him a lot of questions. We have two hours. I am the design process for this deployment. A few things have been changed that have been shown on the Finale diagram. I already have a few interesting ideas on how to better recognize deployment in terms of maintainability, security, reduced susceptibility to errors and reliability.

# Day 3 developer meeting
On Wednesday, and thus the third day, we had an approximately one-hour meeting with all developers at OBJECT. In this round you can all work shortly before and after new me and after exciting tasks. In order to better hear this flood and information, I decided to write it down in the stitch decisions in my notepad. The introductory round was very expensive and I have a wage that I heard a good first from myself. I soon found myself bald after one or the other colleague because I feel I can still learn a lot from them.

I spent the rest of the day directing myself with the commitment, in the personal chapter on guideline harvesting. I also have a pending compliance proposal that I bald belong to my colleagues and our partners.

# Day 4 Inspirational conversation
Today on Thursday I had a super interesting and inspiring conversation with one of our partners. This is in the area of ​​AI (Artificial Intelligence) and a separate company. Alfresco's content management system is just one of many platforms where AI can extract valuable information. I was as important as this founder heard about the personal product with full experience.

My goal is to develop a prototype based on ADF in the past few weeks, which the associated AI AI. I love hearing with ADF. As in the [Blog Post](https://martinmueller.dev/Object-CH/) I love this framework. My idea is to include [Alfresco's ADF app with the name ACA](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-content-app) as the basis for the prototypes.

# Day 5

# Summary
