## Getting started with Git and Github

<https://dev.to/mbugua70/getting-started-with-git-and-github-3mg>

Good roundup for what is Git and the most important commands. It would help you to get more familar with the Git CLI which make me for example very productive. Furthermore I recommend setting this alias:

```bash
alias ginit="git add --all && git commit -m "init" && git push"

gaddall() { git add --all && git commit -m "$1" && git push; }
alias gall="gaddall"
```

So with that I just need line ginit or gall for quickly adding the commit. That was a super productive boost for me.

## Obsidian - An IDE for your Brain

<https://dev.to/envoy_/obsidian-an-ide-for-your-brain-1bn7>

I used Obsidian for some weeks and is really cool. But I figured that VS Code is kind of better when it come to writing / organizing my content. Probably combining both like VS Code for writing and Obsidian for viewing seems interesting.
