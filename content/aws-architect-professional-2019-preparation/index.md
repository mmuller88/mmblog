AWS, endlessly services, we are writing the year 2019 the 9th July at 1 pm. I finally smashed the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional exam. After two failed attempts the last screen on the third try contained the lovely words "Congratulations! You have successfully passed ...". For a tiny moment I probably was the happiest man on earth. The reason why I wrote the post is to helping you to smash that damn hard exam as well!

## My Amazing Equipment:
**Alcohol tester**: Great for figuring out if you are in ketosis or not. \

**Omron Scale**: Measures not only your body weight. Can estimate your body fat, water and muscle composition as well. \

**Bare-Foot Shoes**: Perfect shoes for workouts like tabata, gym or running. Normal modern shoes are bad for your feet as they are overprotecting to your foot which will result in underdeveloped foot muscles and skeleton. A good developed foot is the basement of your body and prevents all kind of resulting issues like knee or back pain. There are many of expensive bare-foot shoes out but some cheap water shoes are completely sufficient. \

**Bluetooth Earphones**: I tested many different bluetooth earphones. I am sticking now with this one because they are cheap but are from very good quality regarding sound, battery and robustness. I can use them for weeks for my workouts without ever charging them! \

**Gymnastic Rings**: Perfect tool for upper body workout. I love it to train outside in the sun and fresh air. As well they are very light so you can take them with you wherever you go. \

**Stainless Steel Water Bottle**: That drinking water is crucial I don't need to explain. I prefer those steel water bottles because there is not risk of plastic in your water. \
