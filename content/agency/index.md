# AWS MVP/AI/Greenfield Agency README.md

## Why

Professionally, I spend about 50% of my time consulting on AWS, primarily for startups (and about 50% on my startup SaaS). I love AWS consulting and want to try horizontal scaling through an agency.

## Customers

### Acquisition

- My personal brand as an AWS/AI/MVP guy works well. However, I want to expand it further.
- I already have a very good customer base and want to utilize it more through referrals, testimonials, and newsletters.
- Being an AWS Community Builder and AWS Meetup leader also makes it easier for me to find new, well-paying clients.

### Value Packages

I want to offer the following value packages in the following prioritised order:

- Project-based with Milestones: The customer pays a deposit and after reaching the particular Milestone
- Project-based with no Milestones: The customer pays a deposit and after finishing the project the rest.
- Paid by hour
- Maintenance contract: TBD.

Bonus package:

- Skin in the game: We can negotiate shares of the product/company to lower the price and strengthen the commitment.

## Employees

### Acquisition

Through the many Lisbon meetups and boot camps where I help out, I have access to committed/promising engineers.

### Requirements for potential employees

- Feeling comfortable programming in TypeScript and Python. (In my opinion, the best MVP/Greenfield languages at the moment.)
- Being self-organized.
- Feeling comfortable to leverage new technologies like AI to improve productivity.
- Being flexible in terms of working hours

### Perks

- Direct revenue sharing with employees. No annoying time tracking and more intensive productive work.
- Full transparency, as far as customers allow.
- Remote/Agile/Async setup with as few meetings as necessary. (Good tooling still needs to be found, but I already know many tools. Recommendations are welcome :))
- Many great learnings as partial compensation.
- Offsites for team building/strengthening.

Please give me your feedback on my project and contact me for potential collaborations :).
