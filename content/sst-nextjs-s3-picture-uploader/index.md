I recently started exploring [SST](https://github.com/sst/sst) as an alternative to my favorite full-stack set consisting of [Projen](https://github.com/projen/projen), [AWS CDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk), and React. I have been thoroughly impressed with the experience so far. In this article, I will demonstrate how to create a Next.js App Router S3 Picture Uploader using SST.

## SST

[SST](https://github.com/sst/sst) is a powerful framework that simplifies the development of serverless applications. It offers a straightforward and opinionated approach to defining serverless apps using TypeScript. Built on top of AWS CDK, SST handles the complexity of setting up your serverless infrastructure automatically. SST is an open-source framework and completely free to use.

SST offers a variety of powerful constructs, including the NextjsSite construct. In the following section, I will provide more details about the NextjsSite construct, which greatly simplifies the process of deploying your frontend.

## NextjsSite

The NextjsSite construct allows you to effortlessly create and manage [open-next](https://github.com/sst/open-next), which is a great alternative for hosting Next.js on Vercel. Being defined within an SST App, you can easily integrate other AWS services, making it incredibly powerful. However, if you're using the latest and most advanced features of Next.js, such as Server Components with the Next.js App Router, you may encounter some challenges.

## Server Components

Server Components are a new way to build with Next.js. They allow you to write parts of your application using React components that run on the server. This approach offers several advantages, such as faster page loading and simplified setup without the need to manage client states with useState, useEffect, and similar hooks. However, working with Server Components may require adjusting your workflow and learning new concepts.

## S3 Picture Uploader

In this section, I will demonstrate how to create an S3 Picture Uploader using the Next.js App Router and SST. We will utilize the NextjsSite construct to create the Next.js App Router and the S3 construct to create the S3 Bucket.

Your can find alle the code in my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mmuller88/sst-nextjs-s3-picture-uploader).

### Initialize SST NextjsSite

All the steps are taking from the official [SST guide](https://docs.sst.dev/start/nextjs).

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Mainly choose the defaults. Then switch to the app folder and open it via VS Code.

```bash
cd <SST_PROJECT>
code .
```

Now run:

```bash
npx create-sst@latest
npm install
```

Before deploying to your AWS Account, ensure that you have set up the correct credentials. I personally recommend using the AWS Identity Service to obtain temporary AWS CLI credentials, but you can also set up IAM User credentials or profiles. Once you have the credentials in place, run the following command:

```bash
npx sst deploy
```

Ensure that the AWS deployment is successful! Access your CloudFront SiteUrl, such as https://abdfhtn2rm9je8.cloudfront.net. Voila! You now have a running Next.js application on AWS with open-next ðŸ¤¯. Let's take a closer look at what has been deployed in our AWS account because it's quite extensive!

To inspect the resources created by SST, go to the AWS Console and navigate to CloudFormation. Click on the newly created stack to view the details. You will find a set of helper Lambda Functions, the Lambda Function and Lambda URL for the Server Component, a CloudFront Distribution, and an S3 bucket that serves the static Next.js files. Additionally, there is a CloudFront Function, although its purpose may not be clear at the moment.

### Add S3 File Uploader

Ok lets go! We need to first create the the API Route in `src/app/upload/route.ts`

```ts
import { writeFile } from 'fs/promises'
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const data = await request.formData()
  const file: File | null = data.get('file') as unknown as File

  if (!file) {
    return NextResponse.json({ success: false })
  }

  const bytes = await file.arrayBuffer()
  const buffer = Buffer.from(bytes)

  // With the file data in the buffer, you can do whatever you want with it.
  // For this, we'll just write it to the filesystem in a new location
  const path = `/tmp/${file.name}`
  await writeFile(path, buffer)
  console.log(`open ${path} to see the uploaded file`)

  return NextResponse.json({ success: true })
}
```

This API route is processing our upload request with extracting all needed information out of FormData like the file and the file name. Now we need to add an S3 bucket where we can upload the pictures to. Go to the `sst.config.ts` file and add a Bucket:

```ts
import { SSTConfig } from "sst";
import { Bucket, NextjsSite } from "sst/constructs";

export default {
  config(_input) {
    return {
      name: "sst-nextjs-s3-picture-uploader",
      region: "us-east-1",
    };
  },
  stacks(app) {
    app.stack(function Site({ stack }) {
      const bucket = new Bucket(stack, "public");
      const site = new NextjsSite(stack, "site", {
        bind: [bucket]
      });

      stack.addOutputs({
        SiteUrl: site.url,
      });
    });
  },
} satisfies SSTConfig;

```

The `bind: [bucket]` allows the NextjsSite construct to have read and write permission to the bucket. Let's update the page.tsx for adding an upload button: 

```tsx
import { writeFile } from 'fs/promises'
import { join } from 'path'

export default function ServerUploadPage() {
  async function upload(data: FormData) {
    'use server'

    const file: File | null = data.get('file') as unknown as File
    if (!file) {
      throw new Error('No file uploaded')
    }

    const bytes = await file.arrayBuffer()
    const buffer = Buffer.from(bytes)

    // With the file data in the buffer, you can do whatever you want with it.
    // For this, we'll just write it to the filesystem in a new location
    const path = join('/', 'tmp', file.name)
    await writeFile(path, buffer)
    console.log(`open ${path} to see the uploaded file`)

    return { success: true }
  }

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>React Server Component: Upload</h1>
      <form action={upload}>
        <input type="file" name="file" />
        <input type="submit" value="Upload" />
      </form>
    </main>
  )
}
```

Let's test it with running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see an upload button. And when uploading a picture it should appear on your machine in the /tmp folder. Cool but wait we want to upload it to S3?! So let's add some AWS SDK stuff to the page.tsx file for uploading to S3:

```tsx
import { Bucket } from "sst/node/bucket";
import { S3Client, PutObjectCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";

export default async function Home() {

  async function upload(data: FormData) {
    "use server";

    const file: File | null = data.get("file") as unknown as File;
    if (!file) {
      throw new Error("No file uploaded");
    }

    const bytes = await file.arrayBuffer();
    const buffer = Buffer.from(bytes);

    // Create an S3 client
    const client = new S3Client({ region: "us-east-1" });

    // Set up the command with the necessary parameters
    const command = new PutObjectCommand({
      Bucket: Bucket.public.bucketName,
      Key: file.name,
      Body: buffer,
      ACL: "public-read", // or whatever permissions you want to set
    });

    // Send the command
    await client.send(command);

    console.log(`Uploaded ${file.name} to S3`);

    return { success: true };
  }

  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
      <form action={upload}>
        <input name="file" type="file" accept="image/png, image/jpeg" />
        <button type="submit">Upload</button>
      </form>
    </main>
  );
}
```

You see how seamingless we can sneak in the AWS SDK s3 upload code? For me that is totally awesome if you like compare with a client side variant where you couldn't do that so easily without exposing your AWS API credentials. But as server components are server side we are save. It really offloads a lot of complexity. Super cool!

Let's deploy that! For more convenience let's add a new command in the package json `"deploy": "sst deploy",`. Now run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Open the CloudFront SiteUrl. Now click on the upload button and check if you can see the file in S3.

BTW. for faster development you could also run locally with `npm run dev` but make sure to load your AWS CLI credentials before which allowing access to the S3 Bucket.

Thanks to [Markus Winkler](https://unsplash.com/@markuswinkler) for the useful Server Component https://ethanmick.com/how-to-upload-a-file-in-next-js-13-app-directory/ which helped a lot to develop the picture uploader that far.

## Conclusion
