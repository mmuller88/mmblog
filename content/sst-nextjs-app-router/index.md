* Just started using SST and I'm totally amazed
* It is a nice abstraction on top of AWS CDK. You easily can and have to use CDK constructs in your sst.config.ts file
* It is totally incredable how nice the nextJsSite construct is easy to setup and to use
* basically all infra code like for the nextJs construct, S3 or Lambda and React code is living next to each other in the src folder. Which makes it super easy to work with
* the SST initialization is super easy and an amazing experience compared to all my other experiences so far like using Projen to setup AWS CDK and NextJS.
* I'm super pumped to work further with SST to make my clients happy and first of all make myself happy :)
